        "#Challenges to Overcome\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main challenges I faced during model selection for the Titanic dataset was determining the most appropriate model between logistic regression and random forest. Logistic regression was simpler and more interpretable, while random forest offered better handling of complex relationships and interactions between features. The challenge was balancing simplicity and performance. I overcame this by evaluating both models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data handling also presented challenges, particularly with feature engineering and preprocessing, such as converting categorical variables into numerical format. To address this, I carefully selected and transformed features, ensuring consistency across the training and test datasets. I focused on appropriate encoding techniques to make the features usable by both models, while addressing any missing data that could impact performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "During model training, overfitting was a concern, especially for the random forest model due to its complexity. To mitigate this risk, I used a validation set to monitor performance during training. This helped ensure that the model generalized well to unseen data and did not just memorize the training set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these efforts, there are remaining areas for improvement. Future work could involve further optimization, such as hyperparameter tuning, to enhance model performance. Exploring ensemble methods and addressing potential class imbalances could also help. Additionally, refining feature engineering and improving model interpretability could be beneficial in further enhancing the modelâ€™s effectiveness."
